# Elevator Control System
Project for SYSC 3303 – Carleton University

Overview:
This project simulates an elevator control system consisting of three main components: the Floor subsystem, the Scheduler, and the Elevator.  
Each subsystem communicates through message passing to handle elevator requests, scheduling, and movement in a real-time simulated environment.

Features:
- Simulated elevator scheduling and motion
- Communication between Floor, Scheduler, and Elevator subsystems
- Handling of recoverable and hard faults
- GUI visualization of elevator requests and positions
- UML class, sequence, and state diagrams for design representation

Components:

    Floor.java                  – Handles floor requests and communication with the scheduler
    TestElevatorSystem.java     – Tests overall elevator system functionality
    TestScheduler.java          – Tests scheduling and timing logic
    Final Project Report.pdf    – Full project documentation and testing results
    UML Class Diagram.png       – One of the UML Class Diagrams
    UML Sequence Diagram.png    – Sequence diagram showing event flow
